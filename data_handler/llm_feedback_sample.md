Thermal comfort interpretation:
- With intense cross-fit and minimal upper clothing, your core heat production is high. The thermal lower layer traps heat and sweat at the legs, reducing evaporation and raising overheating risk—especially if the room is warm or humid. Expect heavy sweating and possible heat strain; during rest you might feel chilled at the torso if airflow is high.

Actionable adjustments:
- Increase airflow and ventilation (fan, open windows/doors); wipe sweat to improve evaporation.
- Hydrate 150–250 ml every 10–15 minutes; add electrolytes for sessions >45–60 minutes.
- Replace thermal lower layer with breathable, moisture‑wicking shorts; avoid “sweat-to-lose-weight” gear (it increases heat strain without meaningful fat loss).
- Add a light, breathable top for rests if you feel chill; remove during sets.
- Use cooling between sets: cold towel/pack on neck or wrists; take longer rest intervals if overheating.
- Reduce intensity or stop if you feel dizziness, nausea, headache, or excessive fatigue.
