Core questions (clothing and activity)

    “How physically active are you right now?”

        Options like: sitting relaxed, sitting and typing/talking, standing, walking slowly, walking fast or more intense.

        This maps directly to metabolic rate categories (met) used in comfort models.

    ​

“What are you mainly doing in this room?”

    Very brief free text or simple list (working at computer, meeting, resting, exercising).

    Lets you refine activity/met or group responses later without extra questions.

    ​

“What are you wearing on your upper body and legs?”

    A small matrix of choices (e.g. T‑shirt / long‑sleeve shirt / light sweater / thick sweater; shorts / light trousers / jeans / warm trousers).

    Enough to approximate clothing insulation in clo without asking for detailed layering item by item.

        ​

Arrival and thermal context

    “How did you arrive just before entering this room?”

        Options: walking/cycling, public transport, car, stayed in the building, other.

        Gives context about pre‑conditioning (e.g. warm from cycling vs. cool from air‑conditioned car).

    ​

“Did you feel warm, neutral, or cool just before entering this room?”

    Simple 3‑point scale.

    Captures recent thermal history and helps explain transient effects beyond steady‑state models.

        ​

Food and drink (metabolic modifiers)

    “In the last hour, have you had any of the following?”

        Options: hot drink, cold drink, hot meal, light snack, nothing.

        Allows you to flag short‑term metabolic and subjective effects (e.g. hot coffee, heavy meal) without a long diet survey.

        ​

Optional but powerful comfort anchor

    “Right now, how do you feel temperature‑wise?”

        7‑point ASHRAE‑style scale (cold to hot) or a simpler 5‑point version.

        This links all the above context (clothing, activity, arrival, food) to an actual thermal sensation label for calibration and modeling.

        ​

With these 5–7 items you can infer clo and met at a useful resolution, account for recent exposure and intake, and still keep the questionnaire short enough to fit naturally into an app without overloading occupants.
