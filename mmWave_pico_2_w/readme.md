This directory contains files for initial mmWave sensor debugging, a library for micropython and the code to locate up to three people and visualize on computer side with processing IDE. 
A datasheet for the sensor is also here. 

code.py - initial debugging and testing sensor (micropython, just streams values in serial)
main.py - code for sensing and streaming data for visualization
processing_ide_visuals.py - local visualizer, runs with processing IDE
rd03d.py - micropython library for mmWave radar we have 
simple.py - mqtt library for pico 2 w, micropython
