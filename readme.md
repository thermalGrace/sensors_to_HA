A compact repo of **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** experiments and tooling:

- 📟 Firmware in **MicroPython** and **C++ (PlatformIO/Arduino-Pico)**
- 📡 Sensor streaming over **MQTT**
- 🖥️ A **Python / Streamlit** dashboard that merges indoor sensors, weather, and user feedback

## ⚠️ Security Notice

**This codebase currently contains hardcoded MQTT credentials, IP addresses, login, and password for our lab network.** These will be removed soon. Always add your own credentials when deploying - currently safe keys handling is not implemented, consider updates for production use.
